# Overview
This Web Service implements [__identifiers.org__](http://identifiers.org) Compact ID resolution API for programmatic access to _ID resolution services_.

Given a _Compact ID_, e.g. _CHEBI:36927_, and being _resolver_ the name or IP address of the host that's running the service, there are two different endpoints that can be accessed, via __HTTP GET__ requests, at the service.
